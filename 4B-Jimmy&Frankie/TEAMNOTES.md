 ## Jimmy Kane 09/21 Lessons Learned from Class
 I learned that we have approached this project the wrong way, mostly because I didn't read the directions closely.  I thought that since we were making a button we were not allowed to use the button tag.  Also this project is much more manageable now than I though it was after watching Bryan go through what he expects.  I also learned there are CSS stylers online to the work of styling for us, which I will be messing with after class today.

 From here there are a lot of changes to come.
 -[* ] Update HTML in Render function to include slot and button tag
 -[ *] Go to a button styler website, style a circle button we link, and add it to styles()
 -[ ] Create a different style for when high constrast, dark mode, or normal is applied to tag
 -[ ] Styling and functional disabeled state

 ## In class 9/27 Comparing to Grey Goose
Write 2 things that are similar in your implementations
* Both of our teams have the hover feature working
* Both of our teams had unessary code that needed cleaned up


Write 2 things that are different in your implementations
* The Grey Goose team had also styled the host page (in their demo file)
* They do not give the end user the ability to change the icon 

List a code snippet or approach you plan on leveraging from their solution
```
<style>
    body {
      background: #000000;
    }
    
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <img src="https://cdn.luxe.digital/media/2020/11/24150129/grey-goose-vodka-bottle-price-size-review-luxe-digital%402x.jpg" alt="Grey Goose Bottle" style="width:100%;">
  <div id="demo"></div>
  
  ```
  We can leverage this to make our demo more interesting.
